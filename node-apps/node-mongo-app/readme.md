# Building a Node.js Application with MongoDB

# Express
Express allows you to quickly build applications, it automates much of the verbose JS you would have to write.
**package.json** 
- To track all of the files in our project we must have the file:
    ```
    package.json
    ```
- We can create this file by running the following command, answering the setup questions defines the package.json file
    ```
    npm init
    ```
- Now we can run a framework such as Express
```
npm install express
```

And this will add a new dependency to our package.json file:
```
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  },
  ```
